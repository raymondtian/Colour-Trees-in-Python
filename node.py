Tree Node
---------

This file contains the information for the tree nodes.
Each node contains a property (colour), the parent and list of children (unordered list).
This node comes with the operations required for basic functionality.
You need to finish off some of those functions though :)

    Node Class
    ----------

    Contains the relevant functions to provide a node in the tree.
    The node has a property, "colour", which represents the colour of the node.

    IMPORANT: **Every node MUST have a colour, there are no blank nodes**

    Functions:

    * add_child(child_node: Node) : adds the child node to the list of children.
    * update_colour(colour: Colour) : changes the colour of this node.
    * is_external() -> bool : Checks if the node is a leaf, returns true if is leaf.
    * children() -> list(Node) : Returns the list of children in this node.
